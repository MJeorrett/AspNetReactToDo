# Asp.Net Core React ToDo
### The project layout, packages and boilerplate I like to use for Asp.Net Core + React + EF Core projects.

This repo contains two projects and details of each are in their own READMEs:
- [Api](./AnrtdApi/README.md)
- [Client](./anrtd-client/README.md)

## Running Locally
You need to run both projects separately:
- Api - Has "F5" support in Visual Studio, just open the .sln and hit F5.
- Client in the client directory run
  - `npm i`
  - `npm start`
