This is the front end of the [Asp.Net Core React ToDo](../README.md) project.

It demonstrates the typical set up I use for react projects including:
- Api calls using axios.
- Api error handling.
- Anti-corruption layer between api and app models to allow the two to change independently.
- Material UI.
- Redux store built using @reduxjs/toolkit.
- Forms using formik.
- Routing using react-router.
- Configuration.
